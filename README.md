# Smart-Contract-Management---ETH-AVAX
A simple contract with 2-3 functions showcasing the values of those functions in the application's front end.

## Description

Solidity contracts are like digital agreements that run on blockchain networks. They include rules around transactions, the creation of tokens, and other contract interactions. They are used in building, creating tokens, ensuring security, and tracking activities utilizing events. Security and gas usage are some of the other important factors to be observed by developers for keeping costs lower.

## Usage/Features

1. Interact with MetaMask wallet for user authentication and transaction signing. 
2. Allow the processing of transactions such as deposits and withdrawals using funds from the MetaMask wallet.
3. Get user account info from MetaMask for a personalized experience
4. Prompt users to connect their MetaMask wallet if not already connected.
5. Support upgradability to change the logic of the contract without breaking its functionality.
6. Optimize gas usage to reduce transaction costs.

### Executing program

* Use any Solidity compiler; I used VS Code.
* I use the template provided by meta crafters (Chris)
* Open the VS code and create a file.
* I go to the terminal and put the necessary words from readme.md
* Once done in the terminal and coding, go to the localhost:3000
* then connect the wallet to the metamask and create an account and network first.
* Once connected, it allows you to deposit and withdraw.


### NOTE

*make sure that the balance is changing when depositing and withdrawing, if you see it change then it means that the transaction is successful.
